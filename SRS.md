## Turn-By-Turn Game Board

Bioshock is a turn-by-turn based game based in space that includes minigames. The game will include four players that can be controlled by human players or the computer. The players will have rockets that are placed on each corner of a grid. Players take in turns to travel across points on the board, the order of players is random. They are given fuel that they can use in order to travel, this fuel slowly runs out as the player travels. However at the end of each round once every player has had their turn, their fuel slightly regenerates. Around the board, different entities will be randomly generated including fuel boxes, asteriods and planets. When a player comes across a fuel box, the amount of fuel they have will increase. Asteriods are obstacles, players will have to travel around them in order to move around. Players should aim to travel to the planets in order to capture the planet. When the player travels to the planet, they are entered into a minigame.

For a player to win, they must have hold a certain number of points.

## Real-Time Minigame

For every minigame, if the player who is trying to capture the planet wins, he is successful, wins the planet and gains points. If the other players win they get bonus fuel and points.

There will be 3 minigames...

• Side scrolling race/runner game
• Some sort of platformer
• Asteroids style
• Doodle jump style
